    """Simulate a model on a regular grid of times, using a function (closure)
    for advancing the state of the model

    This function simulates single realisation of a model on a 1D
    regular spatial grid and regular grid of times using a function
    (closure) for advancing the state of the model, such as created by
    `stepGillespie1D`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : array
      The initial state of the process at time `t0`, a matrix with
      rows corresponding to reacting species and columns
      corresponding to spatial location.
    t0 : float
      The initial time to be associated with the initial state `x0`.
    tt : float
      The terminal time of the simulation.
    dt : float
      The time step of the output. Note that this time step relates
      only to the recorded output, and has no bearing on the
      accuracy of the simulation process.
    stepFun : function
      A function (closure) for advancing the state of the process,
      such as produced by `stepGillespie1D`.
    verb : boolean
      Output progress to the console (this function can be very slow).

    Returns
    -------
    A 3d array representing the simulated process. The dimensions
    are species, space, and time.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import smfsb.models
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> lv = smfsb.models.lv()
    >>> stepLv1d = lv.stepGillespie1D(np.array([0.6,0.6]))
    >>> N = 10
    >>> T = 5
    >>> x0 = np.zeros((2,N))
    >>> x0[:,int(N/2)] = lv.m
    >>> smfsb.simTs1D(x0, 0, T, 1, stepLv1d, True)

    Returns
